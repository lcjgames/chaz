  <h1>Chaz</h1>
  A platformer racer made for the first Bevy game jam.
  <br>
  <a href="https://github.com/lcjgames/chaz">Repo</a>
  <br>
  <h2>How to Play</h2>
  Press A and D to move and the space bar to jump. You can double jump.<br>
  Try to get to the floating heart before your opponent. They have the unfair advantage of having a torch in their hand.<br>
  And if you win, they will steal your moves!
